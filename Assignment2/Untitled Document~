Interesting Observations:
 1. The hyperparameters play a major role in determining the accuracy of the system. The following have been tested:
	a. If the learning rate is too high, the accuracy falls down and training time is faster. But if it is kept low, the convergence is 		slower. 
	b. The loss per epoch initially reduces then after some epochs it will again start increasing. So the number of epochs have been kept 		in an optimal range.
 2. The training and test accuracy are not much different.
