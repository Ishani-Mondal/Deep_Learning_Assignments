Interesting Observations:
 1. The hyperparameters play a major role in determining the accuracy of the system. The following have been tested:
	a. If the learning rate is too high, the accuracy falls down and training time is faster. But if it is kept low, the convergence is 		slower. 
	b. The loss per epoch initially reduces then after some epochs it will again start increasing. So the number of epochs have been kept 		in an optimal range.
	c. We have splitted the training set in the ratio of 5:1 for the purpose of creating training and validation sets. The validation set 		has been used for tuning the hyperparameters. 
	***Note : (Though in the code, we have trained it on the entire training dataset)
 2. The training and test accuracy are not much different.
